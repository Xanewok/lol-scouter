League of Legends Team/Player scouting utility

Old project which served as a utility and allowed to prepare better for a tourney knowing possible roster for given abstract teams.
Uses (old) Riot JSON API via curl.
It tried to detect match a team from individual players' history and to provide some meaningful statistics (most common team composition etc.)
Since the code was created shortly before and exclusively for the tourney and since I came back to C++ after a while, code quality is really bad.
But it served its purpose :)
Leaving it online so someone can have a very basic idea how to use the technology to consume Riot API (at least at that time).
